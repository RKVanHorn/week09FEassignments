      <section class="container border border-dark mb-5">
        <p>
          Reptiles truly evolved to live in harsh environments like the desert.
          Being ectothermic (cold-blooded) means that they can take advantage of
          the high temperatures and abundant sunshine of Mojave summers to
          support their metabolism and aid in things like digestion, waste
          processing and reproduction. Then what happens to reptiles in the
          winter when temperatures reach down near freezing? Reptiles go into a
          state of brumation, similar to the mammalian hibernation we see in
          bears in the winter. During brumation, their heart rates slow
          dramatically, digestive processes slow and they are able to survive
          the winter by "sleeping" it away. The desert tortoise is an animal
          most of us in Las Vegas are familiar with and we wait for Mojave Max
          to emerge from brumation each year, much like folks to the East wait
          for Punxsutawney Phil. Click on the dropdown tabs for each reptile
          below to see how they find the three survival essentials: water, food
          and shelter.

              Desert tortoises have an uncanny abiity to sense when water is
              near and also use changes in barometric pressure to help them know
              when it is about to rain. They will wait by shallow depressions in
              the hard desert surface and drink the water that pools up in them.
              If there are no depressions, they have been known to dig their
              own! Deset tortoises bladders work just like a canteen, storing
              water for months at a time. During the rainy seasons in the
              desert, these amazing animals will drink as much as possible and
              then are able to store it for dry times. They are the ultimate
              water conservers!

            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Food</summary>
              Desert tortoises are herbivores, they eat things like grasses,
              forbes, cactus fruits and even cactus pads! The nice thing about
              being able to eat cactus is that cactus store a lot of water,
              which benefits the animal consuming them. Desert tortoise often
              spend their mornings and evenings wandering their home territory
              foraging for food. During the hot part of the day they will spend
              time in their burrows.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              Desert tortoises really are the penultimate desert survivors.
              Their burrows are one of the reasons why. Desert tortoises have
              incredibly powerful front legs with claws that allow them to dig
              long burrows down into the hard desert ground. These burrows can
              be 6-7 feet long and go down close to 4 feet underground. The
              benefits to such a well constructed burrow are that they protect
              them from predators and they also provide a temperature break of
              up to 20 degrees from the surface temperature. In the summer this
              means a nice cool burrow and in the winter it means a burrow that
              maintains the perfect temperature for brumation.

              <summary>Water</summary>
              Chuckwallas have wonderfully thick, tough skin that helps them
              maintain water in their body despite the high temperatures in the
              Mojave. They are opportunistic water drinkers, but are also able
              to get the majority of the water they need from their diet.
              Reptiles tend to be quite efficient in their waste processing and
              use less water processing liquid wastes, passing urates, a thick
              pasty uric acid, instead of urine.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Food</summary>
              Chuckwallas are mainly herbivores, eating flowers, fruits and
              greens they find during they day. They will also opportunistically
              eat insects that are relatively easy to catch.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              Chuckwallas tend to live in and around rock piles or areas with
              rocky outcroppings. They thrive in the high heat and are often
              seen out basking on top of rocks in temperatures around 110&deg;F.
              Those rock piles provide protection from predators and they also
              hold heat well, so in the evening when the sun goes down,
              chuckwalla will go to sleep in the rocks which stay warm for them
              until morning. Like all the other reptiles in the Mojave,
              chuckwalla brumate through winter. Chuckwalla will use the
              crevices in the rocks when a predator is chasing them. They can
              wedge their bodies in small spaces and then expand their abdomen
              full of air like a ballon, making them almost impossible to
              dislodge.

            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Water</summary>
              Horned lizards use the shape of their body and the channels that
              run between their scales to collect water! During desert rains,
              horned lizards will stand in the rain and flatter their body out
              to help collect water and funnel it toward their mouth. The
              grooves between their scales act like water channels helping to
              move the water in the right direction allowing them to take
              advantage of even the smallest amount of precipitation.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Food</summary>
              Horned lizards are myrmecophagous, which means they eat ants.
              Harvester ant colonies are very common in the Mojave and if you
              find an ant colony, chances are likely that there is a horned
              lizard somewhere nearby. Harvester ants are venomous and have a
              painful sting as well as powerful mandibles that can pack a wicked
              bite. Horned lizards can eat harvester ants because they
              incapacitate the ants with a glob of mucus before they swallow
              them whole!
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              Horned lizards don't build specific burrows or shelters, instead
              they take advantage of the sandy desert ground. They are able to
              quickly bury their entire body in sand using a shimmy type motion.
              Once buried they are virtually invisible and protected from the
              hot sun. They can help control their body temperature by choosing
              warmer or cooler places to bury themself.

              Gopher snakes are opportunistic water drinkers, but can get the
              vast majority of the water they need to survive in the prey that
              they catch and consume.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Food</summary>
              Gopher snakes are constrictors, which means that they grab their
              prey and squeeze them to suffocate and prevent blood flow. Their
              usual diet consists of small mammals like rabbits and gophers
              (hence their name!) as well as birds, other snake and eggs.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              Gopher snakes brumate (reptile hibernation) in the winter in
              abandoned burrows. Often times many different species of snakes
              will brumate together.
