          Mammals in the Mojave have a variety of survival strategies. Most of
          the mammals in the Mojave desert are either crepuscular, meaning they
          are active at dawn and dusk or they are nocturnal, meaning active at
          night. The advantage to these behavioral patterns are that it allows
          them to avoid the extreme high temperatures in the summer. Click on
          the dropdown tabs for each mammal below to see how they find the three
          survival essentials: water, food and shelter.

              Kangaroo rats are amazingly well adapted to living with little
              water. Their kidneys are phenomenally efficient and they are able
              to get all of the water they need from the foods that they eat.

            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Food</summary>
              Kangaroo rats are herbivores, they forage for items like seeds,
              forbes, grasses and fruits. Kangaroo rats have external cheek
              pouches where they can store food as they forage. This allows them
              to forage more effectively, spending less time above ground where
              they may run into predators.

            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              Kangaroo rats live in underground burrows. They will store large
              caches of seeds and food in their burrows. This limits the time
              they have to spend above ground in the heat and potentially
              running into predators. The underground burrows also provide a
              temperature break from extreme cold and hot temperatures.

              Desert cottontails are able to get most of the water from the
              foods that they eat. However, they will readily drink water when
              they find a source. In Southern Nevada, we regularly see desert
              cottontail on golf courses, one reason is the prevalence of water.

              Desert cottontails are herbivores. They forage for items like

              Desert cottontail can live in many types of habitats, but they
              generally live in some type of burrow system. Cottontail are
              exceptional diggers and will utilize existing aspects of their
              environment such as shrubs or rocks to support the burrow.

              Pocket gophers live in underground burrows. Their burrows can be
              complex systems of tunnels and chambers. Gophers are often seen by
              cattle ranchers and farmers are nuisance animals because of their
              ability to tunnel and burrow in all types of terrain. Their large
              ever growing teeth allow them to chew through roots and clumps of
              dirt underground. Their lips close behind their front teeth so
              they don't consume any foreign materials while burrowing. Again,
              like the kangaroo rat, they store food in caches in their burrow
              systems. The underground burrows also provide a temperature break
              from extreme cold and hot temperatures.

              Gray fox are phenomenal at adapting to their environment. Their
              ability to live in and around human settlements means that they do
              well in environments that would seem unfriendly to other animals.
              They can get the majority of the water that they need from the
              food that they eat, but will drink water from any source they can
              find, including bird baths, outdoor pet bowls and fountains!
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Food</summary>
              Gray fox are omnivores; they eat both meat items and plant items.
              In the wild their diets often change depending on the season. In
              spring/summer/fall when wildlife is plentiful, their diets may
              consist of lizards, birds, eggs, small mammals, fruits and seeds.
              In the winter when food is more scarce, they will still consume
              small mammals and birds, but also the seeds from mesquite trees
              and other dried vegetation.

              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              Like all of the other mammals we have looked at thus far, gray fox
              like to live in some type of burrow. Theirs may be more like a
              burrow in amongst bushes or in a rocky crevice/cave. They are
              efficient diggers, but will take advantage of abandoned dens or
              take over a system of burrows of an animal they have predated on.
              Due to their ability to co-exist in human spaces, burrows will
              also often be made in abandoned human spaces like sheds or wood
              piles.
