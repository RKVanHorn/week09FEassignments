        <p>
          Birds in the Mojave utilize many different strategies to survive in
          the desert. Some, such as the Costa's hummingbird are migratory
          visitors, spending time in the desert when there are abundant Spring
          flowers and rains. Others like roadrunners are year round residents
          who are skilled at catching lizards, rodents and insects depending on
          the time of the year. Some birds, like hummingbirds can go into a
          state called estivation where they lower their metabolic rate to
          conserve water and food resources. This state can be triggered by both
          high temperatures and low temperatures. Click on the dropdown tabs for
          each bird below to see how they find the three survival essentials:
          water, food and shelter.

              Hummingbirds get all of their water from the nectar that they
              drink when foarging. They will also readily drink sugar water from
              backyard bird feeders.
            </details>

              <summary>Food</summary>
              Costa's hummingbirds eat nectar from desert plants as well as
              small insects. The nectar is a quick source of sugar and energy
              that enables them to fly quickly to catch small insects like gnats
              that provide the protein they need to survive.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              Female hummingbirds will build nests for breeding, but otherwise,
              hummingbirds roost in trees usually hidden easily by the tree's
              foliage.

              Roadrunners will drink water if they find it, but get the majority
              of the water they need from the food that they eat.

            <details class="card-text text-start">

              Roadrunners are omnivores. They are not very picky and will eat
              whatever they can find including small mammals, birds, reptiles,
              insects, fruits, seeds and other vegetation.
            </details>

              Roadrunners will roost in shrubby bushes overnight, but like
              hummingbirds, really only build a nest during breeding season.

              Burrowing owls can get all of the water they need from the prey
              that they hunt, but will drink water if available.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">

              Burrowing owls are ferocious predators and will hunt and catch
              anything small enough for them to attack safely. Their diet
              usually consists of insects, small lizards, rodents, snakes and
              other birds. They have even been known to hunt bats.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              As their name suggests, burrowing owls live in burrows. Generally
              they will take over abandoned burrows. Burrowing owls that find a
              good burrow will stay with it for years raising a new clutch of
              owlets each year in the same burrow.

              Gambel's quail will drink water that is available, but can get
              enough to survive from the insects and cactus fruits that they
              like to eat.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">

              Gambel's quail are mostly herbivores, with young birds eating the
              occasional insect. They usual diet consists of cactus fruits,
              berries, fresh plant shoots, seeds and flower buds.
            </details>
            <details class="card-text text-start">
              <summary>Shelter</summary>
              Gambel's quail will roost in bushes and shrubs in a group called a
              covey. During breeding season, female quail nest on the ground.
              All their eggs hatch on the same day and from day 1 the chicks are
              ready to follow their parents. Seeing a family of quail running
              around is a common occurrence in summer!
